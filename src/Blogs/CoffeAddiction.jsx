      Caffeine increases productivity, yes it does but this is not enough. You can't be productive with 6 cups of coffee, you need to take care of your sleep routine, mental, and vitamins. Capitalism or any ideology would affect your whole mind just by using caffeine. You need to work harder, then drink that coffee! You need to drive this car, then drink that coffee! You need to buy this house, then drink that coffee.

      Fun fact: In the Ottoman Empire, Turkish coffee was banned because they thought to have a narcotic effect due to the caffeine it contains.

      2 years ago, when I was working on my AI project, I drank 10 cups of coffee to stay awake and this decision ruined my life. I couldn't eat properly, I couldn't sleep and I couldn't think about my project but I was happy. Because this situation made feeling like I was very productive but I was not.

      Nowadays, caffeine is not a central focus of my life, and to be honest, I couldn't be happier.

      I've come to appreciate the calm mornings without relying on that jolt of energy. Instead, I savor the quiet moments, the simple joy of a sunrise, and the clarity that comes with a rested mind. It's amazing how a shift in perspective can bring such contentment.
