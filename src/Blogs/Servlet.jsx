        What is a Servlet?
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A **Servlet** is a Java program that extends the capabilities of a
        server. Servlets are primarily used to process or store a client's request,
        which often involves generating dynamic content, interacting with a
        database, or forwarding the request to another resource. Servlets run
        on a web server or application server and provide a powerful mechanism
        for building web applications.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-green-600 text-xl font-mono mb-2">
        Core Concepts of Servlets
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Servlets are part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform and
        operate on the server side to handle client requests, typically through
        HTTP. They work in conjunction with other Java technologies such as JSP
        (JavaServer Pages) and JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) to
        create dynamic web content.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <span className="text-green-600 font-mono">Servlet Container</span>: 
          The environment in which Servlets run is called a Servlet container (e.g., Tomcat). 
          It manages the lifecycle of Servlets, handles request and response objects, and 
          provides services such as security, concurrency, and transaction management.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="text-green-600 font-mono">Request and Response</span>: 
          The main function of a Servlet is to handle requests from a client (usually a web browser) 
          and return a response. The HTTP protocol is most commonly used for this communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="text-green-600 font-mono">Servlet Lifecycle</span>: 
          A Servlet's lifecycle is managed by the Servlet container, which includes loading the Servlet, 
          initializing it, handling requests, and eventually destroying it. The main lifecycle methods are 
          <code>init()</code>, <code>service()</code>, and <code>destroy()</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-green-600 text-xl font-mono mb-2">
        Servlet Lifecycle Methods
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Understanding the lifecycle of a Servlet is crucial for building efficient web applications. The
        Servlet container manages this lifecycle through several key methods:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <span className="text-green-600 font-mono">init()</span>: 
          This method is called once when the Servlet is first loaded into memory. It's used for 
          initialization tasks, such as setting up database connections or reading configuration parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="text-green-600 font-mono">service()</span>: 
          This is the main method of the Servlet, which is called each time a request is made to the Servlet. 
          The <code>service()</code> method checks the type of request (GET, POST, etc.) and calls the appropriate 
          method (e.g., <code>doGet()</code>, <code>doPost()</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="text-green-600 font-mono">destroy()</span>: 
          When the Servlet is taken out of service, the <code>destroy()</code> method is called to perform any 
          cleanup operations, such as closing database connections or releasing resources.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-green-600 text-xl font-mono mb-2">
        Benefits of Using Servlets
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Servlets offer several advantages for web application development, making them a popular choice for
        server-side programming:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <span className="text-green-600 font-mono">Platform Independence</span>: 
          Because Servlets are written in Java, they are platform-independent and can run on any server that
          supports the Java platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="text-green-600 font-mono">Scalability</span>: 
          Servlets are highly scalable, able to handle a large number of requests efficiently by running 
          multiple instances within a single JVM.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="text-green-600 font-mono">Performance</span>: 
          Servlets offer better performance compared to traditional CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts 
          due to their multithreaded nature.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="text-green-600 font-mono">Robust Security</span>: 
          Servlets support robust security features such as SSL, session management, and role-based access control.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-green-600 text-xl font-mono mb-2">
        Servlet Example: Handling a Simple Request
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Below is a simple example of a Servlet that handles an HTTP GET request. When a client sends a request to
        this Servlet, it responds with a "Hello, World!" message.
      </p>
      <pre className="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-md">
        <code>
          {`import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) 
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.setContentType("text/html");
        response.getWriter().println("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>");
    }
}`}
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p className="mt-4">
        This simple Servlet extends <code>HttpServlet</code> and overrides the <code>doGet()</code> method to process 
        GET requests. The response is sent back as an HTML message.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-green-600 text-xl font-mono mb-2">
        Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p>
        Understanding Servlets is beneficial, especially for developers working with frameworks like Spring Boot,
        which is built on top of the Servlet API. While you may not need to write Servlets directly when using
        higher-level frameworks, knowing how they work can help you grasp the underlying mechanics of web
        applications, making you a more effective developer.
